                <p>The app was meant to run on the last version of Chrome and has not been tested on any other browser.</p>
                <p>To run the application a local web server is needed. Simple python HTTP Server will serve the purpose.</p>
                <p>Once you have your web server up and running please download the source code as pointed in Download section.</p>
                <p>Now extract the downloaded folder and copy the extracted folders to the web server's root folder.</p>
                <p>Open up your browser and type in "localhost" in the address bar then browse to the folder of the app.</p>
