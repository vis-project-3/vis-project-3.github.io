            <p>Most people suggest UIC students to stay near to the university and also to stay away from southern part of Chicago.</p>
            <p>We expected that there are more crimes reported on southern part of Chicago. But this is mot the case.</p>
            <p>Number of crimes are spread evenly around the city thus making Chicago one of the dangerous places to live.</p>
